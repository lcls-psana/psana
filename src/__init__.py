#------------------------------------------------------------------------

"""High-level wrapper module for psana.

Typical usage::

    from psana import *
    
    setConfigFile('config-file.cfg')   # optional, default is to use psana.cfg if present
    setOption("psana.modules", "EventKeys")   # can set/change options from script

    # define "data source" specifying experiment and run number
    datasrc = DataSource("exp=cxi63112:run=111")

    # specify source device for data   
    cam_src = Source("CxiDg4.0:Tm6740.0")

    # loop over all events in a data source
    for evt in datasrc.events():
        frame = evt.get(Camera.FrameV1, cam_src)
        image = frame.data16()

# We believe there is some non-ideal dependency behavior in this package.
# the psana __init__.py depends on psana_python by importing _psana.
# However _psana wraps the C++ code in the psana package, which
# is circular.  Perhaps ideally the C++ code would be moved to a
# different package, but this would break C++ users who would have
# to change their include statements.  We certainly want to keep
# __init__.py in psana so "import psana" works.

# we believe this must be the FIRST import of _psana, so it's important
# that other software that imports _psana (like DataSource) happen
# after this.  one symptom we see if the order is wrong is that some
# of the boost converters stop working, but only on RHEL5.
